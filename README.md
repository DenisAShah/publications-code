# Publicly Available Code

This repository is a collection of publicly available code from my past publications. This repository is for 
storage and reference. More up-to-date versions will be intergrated into my open-source libraries when applicable.

## Organization

Code corresponding to projects are designated by the publication DOI. For publications on arXiv, they are designated 
as such. When published, the arXiv identifier is replaced by the publication DOI.

Each folder will include its only README.md file including the title, abstract, and description of the code structure. 
As integrated into other open-source libraries, I will also link to the functionality.
