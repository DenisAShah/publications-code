### ABSTRACT

Pooled testing has been successfully used to expand SARS-CoV-2 testing, especially in settings requiring high volumes 
of screening of lower-risk individuals, but efficiency of pooling declines as prevalence rises.
We propose a differentiated pooling strategy that independently optimizes pool sizes for distinct groups with different 
probabilities of infection to further improve the efficiency of pooled testing. We compare the efficiency (results 
obtained per test kit used) of the differentiated strategy to a traditional pooling strategy in which all samples are 
processed using uniform pool sizes under a range of scenarios.
For most scenarios, differentiated pooling is more efficient than traditional pooling. In scenarios examined here, an 
improvement in efficiency of up to 3.94 results per test kit could be obtained through differentiated versus traditional 
pooling, with more likely scenarios resulting in 0.12 to 0.61 additional results per kit. Under circumstances similar 
to those observed in a university setting, implementation of our strategy could result in an improvement in efficiency 
between 0.03 to 2.37 results per test kit.
Our results can help identify settings, such as universities and workplaces, where differentiated pooling can conserve 
critical testing resources.
