## Abstract

Missing data are pandemic and a central problem for epidemiology. Missing data reduce precision and can cause notable
bias. We take an example trial that was not subject to missing data and induce missing data to illustrate 4 scenarios
where outcomes are A) missing completely at random, B) missing at random with positivity, C) missing at random without
positivity, and D) missing not at random. We demonstrate that accounting for missing data is generally a better strategy
than ignoring missing data, which remains the standard approach.
